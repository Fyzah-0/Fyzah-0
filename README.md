# Hi, I'm Faiza Iftikhar 👩‍💻

Sociology graduate pivoting into data, policy, and purpose-driven problem-solving.  
Currently exploring the intersection of education, gender, and evidence-based decision making — one messy dataset at a time.

## 🔍 What I do
- Analyze education & gender-related indicators using Python and pandas
- Clean, restructure, and extract insights from large datasets (UNESCO, World Bank, etc.)
- Translate messy realities into clean visuals and clearer narratives

## 🎯 What I'm building
- A portfolio of data-driven projects tied to real-world policy issues
- Python scripts that make my future research life easier
- A headstart in education policy through self-initiated work, not just credentials

## 📎 Skills
- **Languages & Tools**: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), VS Code, Git, Excel
- **Domains**: Education policy, gender equity, research methods
- **Soft powers**: Quiet consistency, critical thinking, finding meaning in chaos

## 🛠️ Projects (coming soon)
- UNESCO Education Indicators: A Data Story
- Gender Gaps in School Enrollment — A Regional Analysis
- Data Cleaning Notebook (feat. blood, sweat, and broken CSVs)

## 🤖 Still learning
- SQL, Power BI
- Advanced Python (APIs, OOP)
- Better naming conventions 😅
